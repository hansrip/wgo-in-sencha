    <p>The tradition of fishing with cormorants goes back at least a thousand years.
        In Ozu it started as a tourist attraction in 1957 and it is one of the three most
        famous ukai spots in Japan. The fishing is done from boats called ubune, which is lit by
        torches as it sails down the Hiji-kawa, the river that runs through Ozu. Cormorant
        fishermen called usho, beat the sides of the boats to encourage the trained cormorants to
        catch fish. They are pulled by long strings attached to rings around the birds' necks which
        prevent them from swallowing the fish. The torchlight attracts fish. When a cormorant
        makes a catch the fisherman pulls the bird in and has it cough up the fish on the boat.
        You can watch this from special sightseeing boats called yakatabune. A meal is served
        while on the yakatabune</p>
    <p>The fare is as follows:

        Adult                Child
        Daytime (12:30- every Sunday)   2,000 yen            1,000 yen
        Night (18:00-)                  3,000 yen            1,500 yen (not including food)
        (With a guide                  4,000 yen            2,000 yen)</p>
